# Code assignment: Rock Paper Scissors

You know it, you played at least once. It's a game of :fist_right: :hand: :v:.

We want you to create an app that:
1. Allow a user to play Rock Paper Scissors.
1. Show a leaderboard
1. Show that the computer didn't cheat.


## The goal is one

**Show us what you've got!**

There is no rush, better to spend more time writing how to run your code than letting us figure it out ourselves.


## The constraints are simple

1. Check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) to know the rules of the game.
2. There are no time limits. We don't care how fast you can code but we do care about the quality of it.
3. Depending on the position you're applying for (frontend, backend, fullstack, mobile) focus on what you know best.
4. Use the right stack. Rely on the [profiles](https://www.sweepbright.com/careers), don't use AngularJs if you're applying for a React position.
5. Use Git. I mean really use Git, don't send us a repo with one single commit. 


## Suggestions

* Use TypeScript if you're applying for a Javascript position. 
* Tests are more than welcome.
* Optionally you can set up some code quality tools.


## HowTo

1. Fork the repo. Keep it private and invite [Sirio Marchi](https://github.com/ohjimijimijimi) to it. 
2. Code wildly but wisely. 
3. Send us an [email](mailto:technical@sweepbright.com?subject=I%20completed%20the%20assignment!&body=Hi%20SweepBright%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20completed%20the%20assignment!%20Now%20it's%20your%20time%20to%20play%20with%20my%20version%20of%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissors.%0D%0AYou%20can%20find%20my%20repo%20at%3A%20%5BLINK_TO_REPO%5D.%0D%0A%0D%0ABest%20regards%2C%0D%0A%5BYOUR_NAME%5D) when it's done.
