# Code assignment: Rock Paper Scissors

You know it, you played at least once. It's a game of :fist_right: :hand: :v:.

We want you to create an app that:
1. Allow a user to play Rock Paper Scissors.
1. Show a leaderboard
1. Show that the computer didn't cheat.


## The goal is one

**Show us what you've got!**

There is no rush, better to spend more time writing how to run your code than letting us figure it out ourselves.


## The constraints are simple

1. Check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) to know the rules of the game.
2. There are no time limits. We don't care how fast you can code but we do care about the quality of it.
3. Depending on the position you're applying for (frontend, backend, fullstack, mobile) focus on what you know best.
4. Use the right stack. Rely on the [profiles](https://www.sweepbright.com/careers), don't use AngularJs if you're applying for a React position.
5. Use Git. I mean really use Git, don't send us a repo with one single commit. 


## Suggestions

* Use TypeScript is you're applying for a NodeJs position. 
* Tests are more than welcome.
* Optionally you can set up some code quality tools.


## HowTo

1. Fork the repo.
2. Code wildly but wisely. 
3. Send us an email when it's done.


## Our values

* **:1st_place_medal: Reach for excellence**: Our goal is to revolutionize the way real estate agencies work, we are only at the beginning of it, and we need to push hard for it.

* **:satisfied: Passion**: We are changing the market, and the way real estate agents work, we have an impact on our customers' productivity and performance and we aim for that.

* **:blue_heart: Thrive together**: We truly believe in collective excellence, which means there is no team better than another, we need everyone to be aligned with our common goal and we work together for the magic to happen.

* **:bulb: Data for efficiency**: We never do things because "it's how we do it for years". With growth comes the issue to see things clearly, but we know that measuring our customer usage, our customer experience, and any of our actions, help us to focus our energy on what's matters.
