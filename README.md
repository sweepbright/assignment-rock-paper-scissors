# Code assignment: Rock Paper Scissors

You know it, you played at least once. It's a game of :fist_right: :hand: :v:.


## The goal is one

**Show us what you've got!**

There is no rush, better to spend more time writing how to run your code than letting us figure it out ourselves. 


## The constraints are simple

1. Check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) to know the rules of the game.
2. There are no time limits. We don't care how fast you can code but we do care about the quality of it.
3. Depending on the position you're applying for (frontend, backend, fullstack, mobile) focus on what you know best.
4. Use the right stack. Rely on the [profiles](https://www.sweepbright.com/careers), don't use AngularJs if you're applying for a React position.
5. Use Git. I mean really use Git, don't send us a repo with one single commit. 


## HowTo

1. Fork the repo.
2. Code wildly but wisely. 
3. Send us an email when it's done.


## Our values

### :bulb: Data for efficiency
We are structuring our teams to scale, and hence we question everyday our processes and ways of work to get it even more efficient, we never do things because "it's how we do it for years". With growth comes issue to see clearly things, but we know that measuring our customers usage, our customer experience, and any of our actions, help us to focus our energy into what's matter. We use date and creativity to understand how to grow rapidly while offering the best experience to our customers.
